This is a quick solution for the Expedia Coding Exercise v1 <https://gist.github.com/Jun-Dai/6101aadf80e47e6c46a3>

##MISSION

The purpose of this project is to provide a simple Web UI to call [Expedia OffersVC Service](https://offersvc.expedia.com/offers/v2/getOffers) , as described in the exercise link above.  

## Language and Frameworks

This solution is built on [Play Framework](https://www.playframework.com/) , a reactive MVC web application framework for Scala and Java.

Scala was chosen as a programming language since I'm already familiar with it, and its fluent syntax and features enhances my productivity.

Bootstrap was used to enhance and streamline UI.

This project was built on top of Lightbend's starter application <https://github.com/playframework/play-scala-starter-example>.

## Running

Run this using [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/).  It was developed and tested using sbt 0.13.16:

```bash
sbt run
```

And then go to <http://localhost:9000> to see the running web application.
